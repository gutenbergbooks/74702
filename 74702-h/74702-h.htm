<h2>KENTUCKY PRESS
ASSOCIATION</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Entertained Here by the St. Bernard
Coal Company in
June, 1878.</p>

<p class="standfirst">COMING AGAIN THIS YEAR.</p>

<p class="standfirst">Emmett G. Logan, Then a Courier-Journal
Reporter, Wrote Up the Trip.</p>

<p class="standfirst">Novel and Elegant Entertainment in the
Mines Reported by Pencil Pushers.</p>

<p>Way back in 1878, when the
editor of <span class="smcap">The Bee</span> was a small
devil in a Madisonville printing
office, and before <span class="smcap">The Bee</span> “angels”
were, the Kentucky Press
Association held its annual meeting
at Hopkinsville, and after
the “business” and a large part
of the pleasure had been transacted,
they accepted the invitation
of the management of the
St. Bernard and Hecla coal companies,
and came to Earlington
for a day of very novel experience
in the green-clad hills and
the rich coal mines of Earlington,
that were then growing from
their early infancy to the great
magnitude and almost world-wide
fame they have now attained.</p>

<p>The output of the St. Bernard
mines in 1878, eight years after
the first pick was struck in the
coal, was 4,407,600 bushels; last
year the output of this group of
mines reached the enormous
figure of 21,825,496 bushels. Then
the St. Bernard and Hecla mines
were the only ones in operation.
Now there are numerous other
large mines, and the total output
of coal from Hopkins county in
1900 was 33,843,500 bushels, or
nearly one-fourth the total output
of the vast coal fields of the
entire State.</p>

<p>This record of the early visit
of the Kentucky newspaper men
to the rich coal fields of Hopkins
county is a matter affecting local
history, and has been treasured
in the memory of many Earlington
people, as it was preserved in
the writings of many an able
journalist, while the memory of
the experience was fresh. One
writer spoke of it as “a most
novel and magnificent affair.”
This occurrence transpired years
prior to the establishment of <span class="smcap">The
Bee</span>, and now it is timely that
<span class="smcap">The Bee</span> should reproduce somewhat
of the record of that event.</p>

<p>Col. E. G. Sebree, Sr., was then
President of the St. Bernard Coal
Company, and Mr. John B. Atkinson
was Vice President and
General Superintendent. Col.
Jo. F. Foard was President of
the Hecla Company.</p>

<p>Gen. James H. Wilson was
Superintendent of the old St.
Louis and Southeastern, now the
St. Louis and Henderson Divisions
of the Louisville and Nashville
Railroad. Conductors E.
H. Mann, John C. Loomis, W.
M. Brady and A. S. Batch were
subjects of especial thanks at the
hands of the press boys.</p>

<p>W. J. Lampton, E. Polk Johnson,
George W. Bain, Urey
Woodson, J. Stoddard Johnston,
I. B. Nall and E. G. Logan were
among the representatives present
who have attained prominence
in press and public circles.</p>

<p>Emmett G. Logan, the orator
of that meeting, now editor of
the Louisville Times, wrote thus
in part in the Courier-Journal
about the Earlington part of the
entertainment:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="standfirst">AN UNDERGROUND BANQUET.</p>

<p>Down in the Hecla the air is filled
with noisome vapors, and upon
emerging we were advised to take
an antidote in the shape of distilled
water, from a spring on which the
moon had never shown, made palatable
by a judicious admixture of
saccharine matter and flavored with
sprigs of an aromatic plant of the
genus Mentha—a piece of advice
that was taken with a good deal of
unction. Then came the announcement
that dinner would be served in
the St. Bernard mine, one mile from
the entrance. I acknowledge that I
received this announcement with an
action approximating a shudder, but
as I was in a strait between two
shudders—one at the thought of
going to the end of a hole a mile long
to get my dinner, and the other at
the appalling prospect of getting no
dinner at all—I determined to face
the lesser shudder and went in the
hole. However, as is frequently the
case, proximity did not mean similarity.
Though the two holes were
near neighbors, there was an infinity
of preference in favor of the upper
one—the St. Bernard, which is located
on a much higher plain and
cut into an entirely different vein of
coal. It is seven feet thick, and
forms a segment of a hill; while the
Hecla is but five feet thick and lies
far down under the valleys. Here
were large, clean cars, provided with
clean seats for six persons, and the
trains drawn over smooth, dry tracks
by two large mules in tandem. There
were a number of trains of six cars
each, and the lights of the miners,
glimmering in the distance like fireflies,
made, what was to me at least,
a novel and interesting spectacle.
Near the point of destination the entry
had been closed by a large sheet,
or drop curtain, and as the train approached
it was drawn aside, and
disclosed to the astonished view of
the upper land-lubbers a truly wonderful
spectacle for such a place.
There was a magnificent gallery,
thee hundred yards long, some
twenty feet wide and ten or twelve
high, lit up by more than a thousand
candles, a band of music filling these
living catacombs with softest symphonies,
and two long tables loaded
with delicacies and presided over by
fair women, spread out before that
hungry crowd. It was a time for admiration
and for appetite.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to fall early
into the hands of Mr. Robinson, General
Foreman of the mines. Eight
years ago the 3d of last May he and
one companion stuck the first pick
into what is now the Great St. Bernard,
with its capital stock of one
million dollars, with a fee simple to
mineral privileges in thirteen thousand
acres of land, and has driven
thirteen and a half miles of entries,
and has five miles of iron railroad
underground and a mining capacity
of 25,000 bushels, or 1,000 tons per
day. Its total output to date is 22,500,000
bushels or 900,000 tons. Output
for the year ending April 1, 1878,
4,407,500 bushels, or 173,304 tons.</p>

<p>Even while the guests of that festive
occasion were enjoying the good
things so lavishly set before them,
there would reach their ears the distant
rumble of blasts fired off far
away in the depths of the hill. There
is no end to the coal there and there
is no limit to the St. Bernard’s facilities
for getting it out. Many interesting
facts and statistics were
furnished me but the loss of a memorandum
book will save them for
another visit and another letter. Mr.
Robinson was born on the Isle of
Man, and is now about forty-five
years old. He has lived in mines
since he was ten and is better satisfied
in the earth than on it. He has
three brothers, foremen in the mines,
and one of his sons is a member of
the mine band that furnished music
for the occasion.</p>

<p>No one in that party will ever forget
the day spent at St. Bernard and
Hecla, or the many courtesies or
goodly cheer received at their hands.
Col. Sebree, Mr. Atkinson and others
were especially attentive to the
wants and wishes of the party. Mrs.
Atkinson, Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Williams
and Miss Lina Judson, who
presided over the subterranean feast,
were embalmed in a resolution of
thanks, as well as in the memories
of the press.</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Nannie Houston Banks, who
is since known as an accomplished
author and a brilliant newspaper
correspondent, was of the party
with her husband, Mr. James N.
Banks, representing the Henderson
Reporter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Banks was, it will be remembered,
shut up in one of the besieged
South African cities—probably
Kimberly—during the Boer
war, while acting in the capacity of
special correspondent to a leading
daily of New York or London.</p>

<p>The following from the Reporter
sounds like the writing of a woman
and we attribute it to Mrs. Banks:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>After they had partaken of the
refreshments so bountifully furnished
on the surface of the earth,
they were invited by the proprietors
of the mines to a feast under the
earth that rivalled in splendor the
dreams of Aladdin. They were conducted
to the main entrance of No.
11 vein of coal, where cars drawn
by mules, had been provided in
which to take the journey; and taking
their seats, each one having provided
himself with a little tin miner’s
lamp, they were whirled into the
bosom of mother earth through a
solid vein of coal eight feet in thickness,
around curves and up grades
for at least a mile—the miners blasting
in the vein beneath, (No. 9,)
sounded like a salute of welcome
from distant canon. Approaching
their destination, away off through
the dark cavern could be seen twinkling
lights, like stars on the brow of
night, which, on a nearer approach,
were discovered to be a thousand
candles lighting up a magnificent
chamber or Hall. The contrast between
the narrow and dark tunnel
through which they had been conveyed
and the lighted chamber was
grand and inspiring; but when on
approaching nearer, the car was
greeted by the notes of the “Red,
White and Blue” from a brass band
stationed at the extreme end, it became
overwhelming, and the souls
that had been hushed into awe and
silence by the wonders of the journey
and the grandeur of the scene
broke forth into loud huzzahs that
made the hallways ring. It brought
to memory the tale of some robber
chieftain returning with his booty
to his home in the cave. Getting
out of the cars they found themselves
in a large and spacious room
cut out of solid coal, with chandeliers
of candles pending from the
roof and jetting out from the sides;
two long rows of tables, capable of
seating two hundred persons, covered
with white cloth and laden with
the fat of the land—mutton, hams,
the nicest of butter, bread and cakes,
the purest old Java and the richest
of cream to give it flavor and color.
Attentive waiters under the direction
of the proprietors were busy in
making each guest whet his appetite.</p>

<p>Several ladies added to the scene
their presence, (each editor should
have had a wife and had her with
him,) among the number Mrs. John
B. Atkinson, the wife of the superintendent
of the St. Bernard mines,
a lady whose noble face and pleasant
and graceful manners marked her
at once as the person who had
planned, executed and carried into
effect this most delightful denouement
to a most elegant entertainment.
Col. Sebree, President of the
mines noted for his indomitable energy
and perseverance and jolly disposition—accompanied
by his gentlemanly
and effective aids, Mr. John
B. Atkinson and Maj. M. M. Kimmell,
the superintendents respectfully
of the St. Bernard and St.
Charles mines, were everywhere
present, adding to the pleasure of
the day and the comfort of their
guests.</p>

<p>The occasion will be long remembered,
and the trip into the mines
with its pleasant contrasts and surprises
will be recounted time and
time again around the fireside and
in the business circles. Very few of
the editors had by ocular demonstration
any idea of the vast coal
resource of Southern Kentucky until
this trip. A vein of coal in which
the tallest man may walk upright
extending for miles in inexhaustible
quantities, was something they had
read of but never seen. There are
others beneath the one they entered
averaging from four and a half to
five feet in thickness, and these are
underlaid by the finest block coal—all
of which when fully developed
will make this section the richest on
the globe.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that attention
may be called more frequently by
the press to our magnificent resources
that immigration may be induced
and they fully developed.</p>

</div>

<p>H. C. Batts said in the Clarksville
Chronicle:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thursday, at 9 o’clock, a.m., we
got aboard the special train, provided
by the St. Louis &amp; Southwestern
Railroad Company and in
an hour found ourselves</p>

<p class="standfirst">AT THE COAL MINES,</p>

<p class="noindent">whither we went on the invitation of
the Hecla and St. Bernard Mining
Companies. About 150 persons composed
the excursion party. After refreshing
the spiritual liquidiam we
were put in charge of Col. Foard,
who gracefully did the Furguson for
us in showing us through the mines.
We were “loaded up” in little cars,
pushed upon the platform and let
down the shaft 90 feet into Cimmerian
darkness.</p>

<p>There mines employ 175 men, and
produce annually 2,226,000 bushels of
coal. After exploring the mines,
seeing the miners “dig” and “blast”
we got in our cars and were drawn
back to the foot of the shaft, and
again drawn up into daylight. We
“refreshed” again, (the refreshment
consisted of lemonade and cigars).
We were then escorted up to
the mouth of the St. Bernard mines,
where several trains of cars stood
ready to receive up. We were in
blissful ignorance of the very</p>

<p class="standfirst">GREAT SURPRISE</p>

<p class="noindent">that awaited us. We were placed in
the little coal cars, nine in each car,
(however, Riley had a special car,
for obvious reasons), an escort of
miners was provided to accompany
us, and we started on our delightful
journey into the ground. For the
distance of a mile and a half with a
clang and a clatter, on the track and
off, we went at a rattling speed. Finally
at a turn in the chute, a scene
suddenly burst upon our vision that
cannot be described nor forgotten.
A quarter of a mile distant we beheld
the materialized</p>

<p class="standfirst">GROTTO OF CALYPSO,</p>

<p class="noindent">an underground paradise of more
than oriental splendor and magnificence.
It was simply beyond description
and above comparison.
Imagine, if you can, a hall 400 feet
long and 50 feet wide lighted with
1,000 wax candles, placed in clusters
at regular distances along both sides
and suspended from the ceiling 40
feet overhead; the walls literally
covered with festoons of flowers and
evergreens; the floor carpeted with
moss and strewn with flowers; hundreds
of bouquets on the two tables
which ran the whole length of the
hall, and hanging baskets of flowers
overhead, while the liberal tables
were weighted down with a dinner
that would have pleased Epicurus
himself. We were struck dumb with
astonishment at this unexpected
sight of fairyland and unanimously
decided to stop our trains that we
might admire the beautiful scene.
Then the whole mountain shook
with the most deafening cannonade;
again and again the terrible thunder
rolled through the caverns, until
the whole mountain to her center
shook. On inquiring, we were told
that it was the miners blasting 80
feet below us, saluting the party.
The cannonade ceased, the band began
to play, and our senses were absolutely
intoxicated with delight.
When we proceeded to demolish the
dinner, and after two or three hours
of unadulterated happiness we reluctantly
left the enchanted grotto.
After listening to a very palatable
paper by Judge McHenry, of St.
Louis, (whose humor, by the way, is
much like that of our lamented
Humphreys, elevated, dignified,
chaste), we started for Hopkinsville,
and at 8:30 p.m., attended the reception
by Dr. and Mrs. Rodman, at
the Asylum, which was a most elegant
affair.</p>

<p>This visit to Earlington was
made June 6, 1878. One week
from tomorrow, Friday, August
2, 1901, the Kentucky Press Association
comes to Earlington
again and will be entertained at
luncheon, details of which will
be given later.</p>

<h2>INJUNCTION CAME JUST IN TIME.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Striking Machinists at Ansonia, Conn.,
Had Become Violent—Some of
Their Acts.</p>

<p>Ansonia, Conn., July 18.—The
effect of the sweeping injunction
granted by Judge E. B. Gager,
restraining the striking machinists,
their unions and their sympathizers
from interfering with
non-union men at the Farrell
foundry, has been to check what
promised to be a serious outbreak
here. The history of the
strike situation in Derby, Steelton
and Ansonia, three small
manufacturing communities, aggregating
possibly 25,000 inhabitants,
shows that there has been
little temporizing on either side.
Four concerns, employing probably
400 machinists, were affected
by this strike, the Ferrell
Foundry and Machine Company
of this place, the Driggs-Seabury
Gun and Ammunition Company
and the Birmingham Iron Foundry
of Derby and the Whitlock
Printing Press Manufacturing
Company of Steelton. Demands
exactly like those made by machinists
all over the country were
made and refused and the strike
began on May 20.</p>

<p>The Farrell Foundry was the
first to begin running its shop
with non-union help. Men from
New York were brought here
about June 15, were placed in
the shop and have been doing
good work, so the company officials
say. The arrival of the
new men was the signal for the
striking employees to begin a
series of actions which resulted
in the injunction. Every day
and night the shop was surrounded
by pickets but the presence
of Sheriff Dunham’s deputies
prevented any pickets reaching
the new men or anything being
done to annoy them until the
early morning of July 4. Then,
to show more thoroughly than
ever that the union men think
that not every man in this free
land is entitled to earn his daily
bread unmolested, strikers or
their sympathizers bombarded
the sleeping apartments of the
new men with skyrockets and
Roman candles, frightening
them, endangering property of
the company.</p>

<p>Several days later one of the
new men left the shop and went
to his home. Returning on Sunday
evening, he was not recognized
by the guard at the shop
door, and admittance was refused.
He fell into the hands of
the pickets and was persuaded to
leave town. Five men boarded
an electric car with him to show
him the way to Bridgeport.
Reaching Derby, he insisted that
two men were enough, unless the
strikers wanted to “do him up.”
The last Ridgeport car having
left, two men started to show
him the road to Bridgeport. The
new man having declared his
willingness to walk.</p>

<p>When the outskirts of Shelton
were reached the electric lights
went out. What happened there
only three men know. The striking
machinists say that the man,
without warning or cause, sprang
on them and slashed them fearfully
with a razor. The man
says the strikers, after kicking
and pounding him, tried to throw
him into the river, and he used
his razor in self defence. He returned
to Shelton, was arrested,
released on bonds, and is back at
work.</p>

<p>On Monday last David Smith,
one of the striking employees,
and A. M. Valentine, another,
returned to work. At 6 o’clock
Smith was followed home and
made a promise not to return to
work. He is old and promised
because, he said, he was too old
to stand the nervous strain. Valentine
is colored and was in
church when the crowd gathered
around his house. The noise
broke up the meeting and Valentine
met a committee in the
church vestry and there made his
promise.</p>

<p>These acts were followed by
the injunction. This injunction
not only prohibits such demonstrations,
but upsets the scheme
on foot to boycott merchants who
sell to the company, and if any
merchant refuses to sell to the
foundry or its employees he becomes
a party to the illegal conspiracy
and subject to the penalties
of such disobedience.</p>

<p>The pickets have all been
called in and one of the head officials
of the machinists who has
been here has gone to Washington
to consult about the situation.
The strike is practically
broken. The Whitlock Company’s
men have all returned, except
such as were discharged,
without gaining a point. The
Birmingham Iron Foundry
started its roll department on
Wednesday with new men and

<h2>UNION STRIKERS MUST PAY COSTS.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Metal Polishers of Dayton, Ohio, Assessed
$586 in an Injunction Suit.</p>

<p>Dayton, Ohio, July 18.—The
metal polishers, as a union or individuals,
will have to pay $586
as costs in the injunction suit
brought against them by the
Manufacturers’ Association. Execution
was issued this afternoon
by County Clerk C. W.
Biser against the Metal Polishers’
Local Union No. 5, and the
several hundred defendants who
were permanently enjoined at
the instance of the Dayton Manufacturing
Company from in any
way interfering with its business,
directing and commanding
Sheriff Keshner to levy upon any
of the goods and chattels of the
defendants or upon any of the
lands or tenements of the defendants
to satisfy the claim for
costs.</p>

<p>The costs were incurred in the
hearing of the injunction suit,
and were in favor of the clerk,
the Sheriff and witnesses. The
fees of the witnesses alone
amount to about $102. The costs
stand as a judgement against the
union and the defendants who
were enjoined by Judge Kumler.
The costs are a lien upon property,
and building associations
will not lend money upon property
so encumbered.</p>

<h2>INJUNCTION AGAINST MACHINISTS.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Restrained From Interfering With Men
Employed by the Holly Co. of
Lockport.</p>

<p>Buffalo, July 18.—In Special
Term today Justice White
granted an injunction order restraining
160 machinists, now on
strike at the Holly Manufacturing
Company’s plant in Lockport,
from interfering with men
now at work or about to go to
work there. It is directed
against the lodge of the National
Association of Machinists “and
others.” The application was
made by Judge Potter, a partner
of Senator Ellsworth. The Holly
company has just secured an
$800,000 contract for pumps for
the Water Department of Cincinnati
and means to employ
non-union men for the work.</p>

<h2>NEW $10 SILVER CERTIFICATE.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">It Has Been Christened the “Buffalo Bill”
as it Bears on its Face the Figure
of a Buffalo.</p>

<p>Washington, July 18.—The
fourth in the series of new silver
certificates, which will be known
as the American series, will
soon be issued from the Bureau
of Engraving and Printing, where
the plates are nearly finished. It will
be a ten-dollar bill and has already
been christened the “Buffalo
Bill,” not after Col. Cody,
but because its distinctive character
will be the figure of a gigantic
buffalo. On the note the
buffalo is headed westward, his
shaggy head well down for a
charge, his tail in a pugnacious
attitude and his matted mane
sweeping the ground.</p>

<p>In this note, as in others of
this series, it is intended to leave
as much open work as possible
with a handsome design, the silk
threads in the paper forming one
of the greatest safeguards against
counterfeiting. In many of the
older notes the threads were almost
entirely obscured by scroll-work.
The subjects for this series
will be confined to American
life, hence the “American
series.” On the one-dollar bill
is the eagle, on the two, George
Washington, and on the five the
handsome head of the Indian
chief, Onepapa. It was suggested
that a picture of the battleship
Maine be used on the ten-dollar
notes and the suggestion
was at first adopted. Later it
was rejected as not distinctively
American and not to be distinguished
from any other battleship.
The department is still
searching for suitable subjects
for the twenty and fifty-dollar
bills.</p>

<h2>Nisbett-Laffoon.</h2>

<p>Madisonville, Ky., July 20.—Mr.
P. Watt Nisbett and Miss

was a surprise to their
friends here. The bride is the

Laffoon.</p>

<h2>DOWN IN THE MINES.</h2>

<p>That Jim Wood and his gang hope
to succeed by practicing deception
is an evident fact. When they first
came to this county they came claiming
that only peaceable means would
be employed in accomplishing their
purpose, but people had but a short
time to wait until they became fully
convinced that their intention was
the use of force, if necessary. Next
we hear of the U.M.W. secretly at
work trying to fill up the mines as
far as possible with union men, under
the guise of being non-union, another
form of deception. Then they
employed colored preachers to go
among their race and deceive them
by lying. But up to this time the
operators have always been aware
of their evil intentions and acts and
have thus far been able to thwart
their evil purposes. And Agitator
Wood need not think for a moment
that his slick scheme to get union
men in large numbers into this
county on July 27th, by advertising
a free barbecue, is unknown to the
operators of our coal mines. His
movements and plots are well known
and will be met.</p>

<p>The diabolical plot to thus bring
in a large crowd of thugs from other
States to capture and shut down the
mines of this county has been unearthed,
and unless steps are taken
to prevent any attempt by force on
that day to accomplish their purpose,
bloodshed will follow, as
there are now, at a moment’s notice,
thousands of brave men in this
county who will risk their lives in
defense of the miners and operators
of this county who are willing and
ready to work and have no grievance
to settle.</p>

<p>Naturally, the closing down of
many large steel plants will cut the
demand for coke and coal and the
miners as well as every other industry
will suffer during the strike.</p>

<p>The scarcity of U.M.W.’s at mining
points the last week or two is
quite noticeable. With the exception
of Madisonville, where they can
be found around the saloons building
air castles, very few are seen.</p>

<p>Cols. Dick Salmon and Artemus
Ward were over last week. They
complained of a scarcity of coal cars
at the Crabtree mines for a few days.</p>

<p>A former employe at the Barnsley
mine, a young Mr. Harris, was one
of the victims of the late railroad
wreck near there last Thursday
night.</p>

<p>So extremely warm has been the
weather that the miners dread the
trip to and from work. The mine is
the place sought by them at present.</p>

<p>Henry Jones has joined the mechanical
force of the St. Bernard
Coal Co., and as he has been in the
Philippines, where the thermometer
often registers 120 in the shade, he
is able to stand the weather here
first rate.</p>

<p>Some new slack washers to replace
old ones are now being put in at the
coke ovens during the lull in business.</p>

<p>The severe drouth in this county
will have a serious effect on all business
outside of coal mining, an industry
of vast importance to the
county, but, strange to say, one that
many people are now in a conspiracy
to ruin, if possible.</p>

<p>As is usually the case during the
heated season, the stock of coke accumulates,
and many car loads can
be seen stacked up ready for the big
winter demand. On account of the
falling off of orders in the summer,
the St. Bernard never decreases its
production, but has a big winter supply
on which to begin.</p>

<p>A big coal miners’ strike has been
averted in Missouri by both sides in
the controversy conceding some
minor points.</p>

<p>Like it is with the mine operators
in this county, the steel magnates
claim there is nothing to arbitrate.
It is simply a question of who shall
operate the works, a gang of agitators
or men of sense and means who
have investments trusted to their
care.</p>

<p>The idle U.M.W. boys now employ
a portion of their time jumping
freight trains and stealing rides.
They have ceased to work in the
mines and have become violators of
the law, another proof that idleness
always begets crime.</p>

<p>Secretary Hall, of the Oakhill Coal
Co., made a business trip north last
week. He is out after business and
is determined to show the poverty
producers that his mine will continue
to run in spite of threats and intimidation.</p>

<p>Agitator Wood certainly underestimates
the intelligence of our
Hopkins county miners, when he
thinks that a sop thrown out to them
in the shape of a free barbecue will
entice them to join the ranks of the
U.M.W., who have nothing but
misery and poverty to promise them
in return for servile obedience.</p>

<p>An eastern judge has the proper
conception of what constitutes abusive
and offensive language, as will
be shown by his decision here given:</p>

<p>“The scabs have come to town.”
He was promptly arrested, although
he had not spoken in a loud voice or
to any crowd. Davis was fined $50
and costs—$62.50 in all—by Judge
Bryant in the city court.</p>

<p>“And I want to add,” continued
the judge in imposing the fine, “that
if any one else comes before me on
the charge, I will not only fine him
fifty dollars, but send him to jail for
six months.” Davis’ fine was paid by subscription.</p>

<p>One William Blakely, a member
of the U.M.W., who is evidently
paid to write articles which will
place that organization always in
the front regardless of the facts in
the case, has lately written to a labor
journal an account of the trouble
between Gabe Stokes and Agitator
Rooney, wherein he shows his usual
love for prevarication. The statement
made that Gabe Stokes and
Roy Blanks showed the white feather
by quickly leaving is entirely false.
The writer was present and can testify
so far as he saw that they beat
no hasty retreat, but stood their
ground like men when they were
outnumbered two to one. It seems
that the only fact stated by Blakely
is that Rooney shot Stokes in the
face when Stokes was some distance
away from him and not going towards
him. If cowardice was shown
it was when a party of U.M.W.s
implicated in the trouble ran and
shut themselves up in a house when
they were heavily armed, and begged
to be allowed to surrender.</p>

<h2>REPUBLICAN CONVENTIONS.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Saturday in Precincts and Monday in
County Meeting Will Name Candidates.</p>

<p>Saturday is the day on which
the Republicans of Hopkins
county will meet in precinct conventions
to send delegates to the
county convention at Madisonville
the following Monday,
July 29th, to select candidates
for county offices.</p>

<p>The spirit of self sacrifice for
public good seems to be abroad
and no great number of office
seekers are announced. The
ticket, whoever is chosen promises
to be a good, clean, strong
one.</p>

<p>Among those known to be in
the race are H. F. Porter for
County Judge, Thos. E. Finley,
for County Attorney, L. F. McLaughlin
for Representative, C.
H. Murphey for County Clerk,
Robert Morrow for Sheriff, W.
H. Lynn for Assessor; Miss
Story and Professor Lutz for Superintendent
of Schools; G. W.
Gower, Henry Johnson, B. F.
Young, J. T. Harris, Mr. Barnes,
of Nebo for Jailer. There may
be others, but they have not announced
in the newspapers.</p>

<h2>TROPICAL TEMPERATURE.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">The Fervent Heat Seems to Gather
Strength With Each Succeeding
Day.</p>

<h3>CENTURY MARK AGAIN LEFT BEHIND.</h3>

<p>Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska,
Indiana and Ohio Appear
to Be Covered by the Hot Blanket—Deaths
and Prostrations Numerous.</p>

<p>St. Louis, July 23.—Monday will go
on record as the hottest day in St.
Louis up to date.</p>

<p>At 11 o’clock the mercury stood at
102 degrees on top of the federal
building, and was climbing at the rate
of two degrees an hour.</p>

<p>At noon it registered 105 degrees
and gradually climbed to 107 by the
official thermometer, while street
readings showed as high as 110.</p>

<p>The heat belt covers a radius around
St. Louis of 100 miles. St. Louis is
almost the central point.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon
St. Louisans experiences a
veritable hot wave, lasting several
minutes. It seemed as though the
doors of the nether regions had been
thrown open and a hot blast emitted
that seemed to almost blister everything
it came in contact with. As on
Sunday, night brought little relief
and sleep was almost out of the question.
The protracted hot spell is having
a depressing effect, and much illness,
especially among the aged, is resulting.</p>

<h3>AT KANSAS CITY.</h3>

<h4>The Hottest Weather Ever Known—Nine
Fatalities Reported.</h4>

<p>Kansas City, Mo., July 23.—A veritable
hot blast literally scorched this
city Monday, breaking all heat records
in the history of the local weather
bureau. Sunday, Kansas Cityans
experienced the hottest weather ever
known here, the government thermometer
reaching 104 and remaining
above the 100 mark for seven consecutive
hours. Two dozen prostrations,
nine fatally, was the result.
Monday, at 3:30 o’clock the bureau
thermometer at the highest point in
the city showed 106 degrees, while
thermometers in the business district
on the streets reached as high as 128.
The thermometer at 8 a.m., registered
90, was 101 at noon, and at 3
p.m. broke the record at 104.6. Hardly
a breath of air stirred. The suffering
was intense, especially among
persons compelled to work out doors
and in the poor districts in the bottoms.
Seven deaths from prostrations
were reported during the day
in Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City,
Kas., and over thirty people, overcome
by the heat, were treated. This
makes a total dead for the two days
of 16. Most of the victims were elderly
people.</p>

<p>The highest previous temperature
in history of the Kansas city weather
bureau was 103, in August, 1896, but it
only remained near that point for one
day. Monday was the thirty-second
in succession on which the temperature
has averaged above 90 degrees,
and the fifteenth in that time that
the thermometer has gone above 100.</p>

<h4>Two Deaths at Sedalia.</h4>

<p>Sedalia, Mo., July 23.—There have
been two deaths from the heat here.
The government record of temperature,
Monday, showed 106 degrees.</p>

<h4>A Corker at the Capital.</h4>

<p>Jefferson City, Mo., July 23.—Monday
was equal to last Friday as the
hottest day of the season, the government
thermometer standing at
114.</p>

<h3>HOT TIMES IN IOWA.</h3>

<h4>Des Moines Has the Highest Temperature
in Its History.</h4>

<p>Des Moines, Ia., July 23.—The government
thermometer registered 109
degrees here at 3:30 Monday afternoon,
the highest official record in the
history of Des Moines. Two deaths
from the heat and numerous prostrations
were reported.</p>

<p>According to reports to Director
Sage, of the crop bureau, and to local
grain men, the past few days have
been disastrous to Iowa corn, except
in localities which have had rain recently.</p>

<h4>108 at Keokuk.</h4>

<p>Keokuk, Ia., July 23.—The weather
bureau recorded 108 degrees of heat
here Monday, it being the sixth day
of temperatures above 100 and the
thirty-second of above 90. All reports
indicate that corn is being seriously
damaged.</p>

<h4>At Sioux City.</h4>

<p>Sioux City, Ia., July 23.—The maximum
temperature here, Monday, was
105, three degrees below Sunday’s
maximum.</p>

<h3>SCORCHING IN KANSAS.</h3>

<h4>Three Deaths and Ten Prostrations
Reported at Topeka.</h4>

<p>Topeka, Kas., July 23.—Three deaths
and ten prostrations form Monday’s
record of the heat in Topeka. The
thermometer registered 106 as its
maximum. It has been three degrees
higher during the heated season, but
the humid air made the day the most
oppressive of the year. Most of the
active work was stopped for the day.
The Kansas river is very low, but the
supply of water in the city mains is
as yet plentiful.</p>

<p>At Lawrence, the state university
reported the heat record for Kansas
again broken, with the mercury at
106.5 degrees, the highest in 34 years.</p>

<h4>At Leavenworth.</h4>

<p>Leavenworth, Kas., July 23.—At Fort
Leavenworth, Monday, the weather
bureau thermometer registered 108
degrees, as against 106¼ on Sunday.
Capt. R. H. Allen, post adjutant, was
prostrated by the heat, while at his
desk in the afternoon, and taken to
his home. Five other prostrations
were reported.</p>

<h4>No Signs of Abatement.</h4>

<p>Sylvan Grove, Kas., July 23.—The
heat, Sunday, was the most terrific of
the season. The thermometer registered
and maintained 111 from ten
until four o’clock. Monday morning
at eight o’clock it registered 102. The
drought still continues, with no signs
of abatement.</p>

<h3>UNCOMFORTABLE AT OMAHA.</h3>

<h4>Eight Deaths and Four Prostrations
the Day’s Record.</h4>

<p>Omaha, Neb., July 23.—The weather
conditions, Monday, continued of the
most uncomfortable nature. The
temperature at 7 a.m. registered 83
and at noon the 100 mark was reached
with 104 at 4 p.m., only eight-tenths
of a degree below Sunday’s high record
of the day. At 5 p.m. a refreshing
breeze came up and afforded some
slight measure of relief.</p>

<h3>ALL RECORDS BROKEN.</h3>

<h4>Springfield, Ill., Showed 107, the
Highest Ever Recorded There.</h4>

<p>Springfield, Ill., July 23.—All heat
records in Springfield were broken,
Monday, when, for three hours, the
mercury in the government thermometer
stood at 107, the highest ever recorded.
Thermometers on the street
level registered as high as 110 in the
shade. There were several prostrations.
Director Guthrie of the local
weather bureau states that reports
from all over the state indicate that
the corn is withstanding the heat and
drought remarkably well.</p>

<h3>INDIANA CATCHING IT.</h3>

<h4>Indianapolis Has the Hottest Day on
Record There.</h4>

<p>Indianapolis, Ind., July 23.—Monday
was the hottest day on record in Indianapolis.
The official record was
106 at two o’clock in the afternoon.
At the same hour thermometers along
the business streets recorded 110
and 112. There were two deaths and three
prostrations from heat.</p>

<p>At the camp of the Indiana national
guard all drills were suspended. Sixty
men were overcome during the day,
but all rapidly recovered, with the exception
of seven, who are in the brigade
hospital. Many animals were
stricken, and livery men are refusing
to hire horses.</p>

<h4>All Previous Records Eclipsed.</h4>

<p>Cincinnati, July 23.—All previous
heat records here were eclipsed, Monday,
when the official government
thermometer at the office of the local
weather bureau reached 106 degrees
at 2:30 in the afternoon, and remained
there for about an hour. Fortunately
the humidity at that time
registered only 25, and there were
but few prostrations.</p>

<h2>RETAIN MORRO CASTLE.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">The United States Government Will
Garrison and Hold the Famous
Stronghold.</p>

<p>New York, July 20.—In addition to
the other bases of supply demanded
in the Platt amendment, it is the intention
of the administration to
permanently retain Morro castle,
overlooking the harbor of Havana.
This the Washington correspondent
of the World says is announced on
the highest authority. It is the intention,
says the World’s special, to
occupy, control and defend the
stronghold with United States troops
after the government of the island
has been handed over to the Cubans.
The plan is to equip the fortress with
modern artillery, in order that Cuba
may be assisted in defending herself
against outside interference, and also
that the United States may thus
have a guarantee against failure on
the part of the Cuban government to
carry out its pledges and the terms of
the treaty now in course of preparation
as between this country and
Cuba. Under this treaty the retention
of the fort is provided for.</p>

<h3>The Castle is Crumbling.</h3>

<p>At this time Morro castle is crumbling
with the weight of years and is
of small account as a fortress. Spain
was 100 years in building it. The fort
was begun in 1667 by Oregon Gaston,
governor of Havana, with money from
the receipts from Mexico, then owned
by Spain. Millions of dollars were
squandered upon it, and when it was
completed it was acknowledged to be
one of the most formidable forts in
the world.</p>

<p>But Spain was not satisfied, and $3,000,000
more was expended upon the
castle during the governship of Juan
Francisco Guymas, who, when the
work was finished, said: “Pass it who
can.”</p>

<h3>Became a Dreaded Prison.</h3>

<p>Morro eventually became the most
dreaded of all the prisons of Spain.
Men of all classes, rich and poor, high-born
and humble, have entered its
gates never to return to their friends.
It was really more as a prison than as
a fort that Morro became known
throughout the civilized world. Hundreds
upon hundreds of men have
died the slow death of despair in its
subterranean vaults. From it there
was no escape unless the magic power
of money was at hand to aid the
unfortunate.</p>

<p>Some years before the war of this
country with Spain Morro castle was
restored to its original use as a fort
and Cabanas became the principal
prison of the island and one of the
most wretched in the world.</p>

<h2>WEEKLY CROP REPORT.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Intense Heat in the Central Valleys
and Middle Rocky Mountain
Region.</p>

<h3>DROUGHT AREA LARGELY INCREASED.</h3>

<p class="standfirst">Outlook for Corn Less Favorable—In
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky
is in Need of Rain—Practically
Ruined in Missouri and
Kansas—Other Crops.</p>

<p>Washington, July 24.—Following is
the weather bureau’s weekly summary
of crop conditions:</p>

<p>Intense heat has prevailed another
week throughout states of the central
valleys and middle Rocky mountain region,
with only local showers over
limited scattered areas. Maximum
temperatures of 100 degrees or above
were of daily occurrence over more
or less of the territory named. Under
these conditions the drought has
been greatly intensified, and its area
largely increased. Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma and portions of Nebraska
have suffered most, but the conditions
are now critical from the lake region,
central Ohio valley and Tennessee
westward to the middle Rocky mountain
region, including the greater
part of Texas. Portions of the middle
and South Atlantic states continue
to suffer from excessive moisture,
but very favorable temperatures have
been experienced in these districts,
and also on the Pacific coast, where
the week was cooler than usual.</p>

<h3>The Outlook for Corn.</h3>

<p>The outlook for corn is less favorable
than at the close of the previous
week. In Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma
and Missouri early corn is practically
ruined. With early and abundant
rains in these states late corn
would probably make half a crop or
less. The condition of the crop in
Iowa is more favorable than in the
before-mentioned states, and copious
rains with moderate temperatures
within a week would greatly improve
prospects for a large part of the
crop. In Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky
and Tennessee, more particularly
the western portions of the last-named
states, corn is now seriously
in need of rain. In Illinois the crop
has not yet sustained great damage,
but will be materially reduced unless
the drought is relieved within a week.
In the middle Atlantic states the conditions
have been highly favorable
for corn and its condition is further
improved.</p>

<h3>Wheat and Oats.</h3>

<p>Moisture has done considerable injury
to winter wheat in shock in the
middle Atlantic states. Harvesting
continues where unfinished, in the
more northerly section east of the
Rocky mountains, and is in general
progress on the north Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Spring wheat harvest has begun
over the southern portion of the
spring wheat region, where, as a result
of premature ripening, the yield
and quality is much impaired. Over
the northern portion, where the crop
is now ripening, its condition continues
promising.</p>

<p>Harvested oats have suffered some
injury in shock from moisture in the
middle Atlantic states, and the unharvested
crop from premature ripening
in the northwest, while rust has
caused injury from the upper Ohio
valley.</p>

<h3>Hay and Cotton.</h3>

<p>Haying is mostly finished and a fine
crop was secured in North Dakota,
Minnesota, the lake region, Ohio valley,
portions of the middle Atlantic
states and New England.</p>

<p>In portions of Mississippi, Alabama,
Georgia and Florida the condition of
cotton has improved, but in the two
last-named states and in the Carolinas
it has suffered from lack of cultivation.
Rain is greatly needed in Tennessee
and over the western portion
of the cotton belt, where, however,
the crop is generally withstanding
the drought well.</p>

<h3>Tobacco and Fruit.</h3>

<p>In the Ohio valley, Tennessee and
Wisconsin, tobacco is suffering much
from drought, especially in western
Kentucky, and has been injured by
rains in Maryland; elsewhere the crop
has made favorable progress.</p>

<p>Throughout the central valleys the
prospects for apples have been further
reduced, and no improvement is
reported from New England and the
middle Atlantic states. On the whole,
the fruit outlook is not encouraging.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>Forest Fires in Montana.</h2>

<p>Helena, Mont., July 21.—Fierce forest
fires are reported raging west of
Missoula. The Northern Pacific and
Anaconda companies have large
forces of men at work endeavoring to
prevent their spreading. There are
several distinct fires, and the loss will
probably be heavy.</p>

<h2>Constitution the Fastest.</h2>

<p>New York, July 23.—The race between
the Constitution and the Columbia
on Long Island sound, Monday,
again demonstrated that the
Constitution is the faster fair-weather
craft. In a light breeze and
smooth water, over a 21-mile course,
Columbia was defeated 4 minutes 18
seconds.</p>

<h2>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</h2>

<h3>COUNTY CLERK.</h3>

<p>GILLILAND—We are authorized to announce
John R. Gilliland, of Ilsley Precinct, Postoffice
address St. Charles, a candidate for County
Clerk, subject to the action of the Republican
party.</p>

<p>MURPHEY—We are authorized to announce C.
H. Murphey, of Madisonville, a candidate for
County Clerk, subject to the action of the voters
of Hopkins County at the November election.</p>

<h3>JAILER.</h3>

<p>HARRIS—We are authorized to announce J. F.
Harris a candidate for Jailer, subject to the
action of the Republican Party.</p>

<p>GOWER—We are authorized to announce G.
W. Gower, of Madisonville, a candidate for
Jailer, subject to the action of the Republican
party.</p>

<h3>ASSESSOR.</h3>

<p>LYNN—We are authorized to announce W. H.
Lynn as candidate for Assessor of Hopkins
county, subject to the decision of the Republican
convention to be held on Monday, July 29.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>A rabbi, of Wabash, Ind., offers

<p>A Cleveland man who would
not support his children was arraigned
in court by a humane

and given ninety days. His sentence
will keep him in the work

good place for a man who will
not work outside.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>W. H. Lynn announces as candidate
for Assessor of Hopkins
county subject to the decision
of the Republican party in convention
at Madisonville Monday,
July 29. Mr. Lynn is thus far
the only candidate to announce
his candidacy publicly. He is a
man well qualified for the place,
knows the county and its people
well, but says with commendable
patriotism that if there is a man
found who wants the place and
is better qualified than himself,
he is for that man.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>A dispatch from Wilkesbarre,
Pa., relative to the strike of the
stationary firemen says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>More mines were in operation and
more coal was hoisted in the Wyoming
valley today than any day
since the stationary fireman’s strike
began. Despite any action that may
be taken by the officers of the United
Mine Workers’ association, the fact
cannot be denied but that the United
Workmen as a body are anxious to
get back to work. How long they
can be kept out by the executive
heads is entirely problematical.</p>

</div>

<p>History is repeating itself in the
matter of union dictation to
men who would work if they
were not interfered with.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>Debs On the Steel Strike.</h2>

<p>Eugene V. Debs in a speech at
the Kankakee, Ill., Chautauqua
last Saturday had this to say on
the question of the steel strike:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is no use for the Federation
of Labor to bluff, for it
simply injures the cause of labor
with the American people. The
Federation has not two million
members. It has not half that
number. When it says it can
raise $500,000 a week, it is simply
bluster and blow. It cannot
raise $5,000 a week. I have had
experience in raising money for
strikers. It is not thus that
strikes are settled.”</p>

</div>

<p>Eugene ought to know what a
strike bluff is and seems to speak
honestly this time.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>Mr. Gower for Jailer.</h2>

<p>In this issue appears the announcement
of G. W. Gower, of
Madisonville, for Jailer of Hopkins
county, subject to the action
of the Republican convention,
which meets at Madisonville next
Monday, July 29. Mr. Gower is
well and favorably known
throughout the county and has
served very acceptably in the
past as city marshal of Madisonville.
No one is better qualified
for the office than he. He is
making an active canvas for the
nomination and says if his is favored
by the convention he will
do his utmost to see the entire
ticket elected in November.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>“Enforce the Law.”</h2>

<p>We quote from Glenn’s Graphic
a comment on what came near
being a serious riot at the county
seat on Monday of last week:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is no one who is in favor of
law and its enforcement who can or
will defend these men in their unlawful
acts of last Monday. Here
in Madisonville, a town that in the
past has been noted as being the
most quiet and orderly in the state,
an officer in the discharge of his duty
attempts to arrest a man for an
offense committed. The man refuses
to be arrested, two of his race come
to his rescue and they interfere by
demanding that the officer shall turn
the man loose and go and arrest the
other—a white man, before they
would agree to the arrest. These
men were not citizens of this county,
some of them were not citizens of
the state, they are colored men from
elsewhere, yet in broad daylight, in
the presence of the people they defy
the officer of the law.</p>

<p>How do the people of Madisonville,
of Hopkins county like this state of
affairs? Are they pleased to see
colored men from elsewhere parade
our town with pistols and when an
officer attempts to preserve order
and enforce law, have bullies set up
themselves in defiance to the constituted
authorities?</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>Business or Votes.</h2>

<p>Business men of Wellsville,
Ohio, which place has for the
past several days been called the
“storm center” of the steel
strike, have been using their influence
to prevent the steel workers
joining President Shaffers’s
strike for union supremacy. Confronted,
as they are, with what
seems a certainty that if the
present trouble goes much farther,
the Wellsville plant will be
lifted and taken across the line
into Pennsylvania. Many of the
men realize the force of this argument
which is emphasized by
the fact that they are themselves
owners of Wellsville property,
the value of which is dependent
upon the regular operation of
the steel works at that point.
One prominent man, however,
opposes the position taken by
the merchants. Mayor Dennis,
who seems to think the votes
lie in the direction of union
workmen and sympathizers, says
the business men ought to keep
out of it.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>Sound Sense</h2>

<p>Sam Jones says many reckless
and foolish things, but he also
says some very true and sensible
things. Referring to strikes and
the rights of the laborer, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I believe a dozen men or a thousand
men or a million men have a
perfect right to strike whenever they
gentlemanly please—lay down their
implements and quit work, and
right there and right then they have
done everything they have a right to
do by human and divine law, and
when they do any more they outlaw
themselves and ruin their cause.
Capital has a perfect right to discharge
labor whenever it gentlemanly
pleases, but when capital says “I
will not employ you, and no one else
shall employ you,” then capital has
outlawed itself and damaged its
cause. Capital has as much right to
run around to the employers of labor
in this country and beat up or cuss
down anybody that will employ their
discharged men as laboring men have
to hang around the shops and mines
from which they have been discharged
or voluntarily severed their
connection, with sticks and rocks
and say to capital: “We won’t work
for you, and nobody else shall work
for you.”</p>

</div>

<p>Samuel’s English may be a
little lame at times, but the
proposition he here lays
down is based on sound sense
and justice.—Nashville American.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>When?</h2>

<p>Mr. Shaffer, the man who is at
the head of the big steel strike,
said in a speech at Wellsville
last week:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Many of the older workmen present
who have worked with me in the
rolling mills know what the word
“strike” means. In those old days
we used to close the mills, throw out
pickets, guard the railway depots
and lay in a good supply of intoxicating
spirits, thus priming for mischief
and depredations of any sort.
If persons thinking other than we
did came to take our positions they
were beaten and sent out of town.
We do differently now.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be interesting to know
just when strikers began to do
differently. Such words as these
by the President of the Amalgamated
Association would be far
more impressive if spoken at the
end instead of the beginning of
the strike. Let us hope that they
can be spoken then.—Courier-Journal.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>The Steel Strike and the Future of American
Industry.</h2>

<p>The strike ordered by the
Amalgamated Association of
Iron, Steel and Tin Workers for
the purpose of coercing three of
the companies embraced in the
United States Steel Corporation
will be regarded with keen interest
by all persons acquainted
with the grounds on which the
manufacturers of the United
States are able to compete with
those of Great Britain and other
European countries. We do but
state the naked truth when we
say that, if this strike should
prove successful, our employers
of skilled labor would be gradually
subjected to disabilities
which, ultimately, would put an
end to the hope of competition
with their transatlantic rivals in
the markets of the world.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference
between the powers of extensive,
quick and improved production
possessed by American manufacturers,
on the one hand, and by
British manufacturers on the
other, is that, by comparison, the
latter are now, and have been
for a good many years, under the
heel of the trade unions. In almost
every branch of British
manufactures the trade unions
prescribe, not only the rate of
wages and the hours of labor, but
also the amount of work to be
performed by a given workman
in a given time, and the kind of
machinery to be used. Instead
of opening a career to energy,
assiduity and talent, the whole
system of British industry, as
organized by the trade unions, is
adjusted to a low average capacity
of diligence and of intelligence.
Far from being encouraged,
a vigorous or a specially
skillful workman is discouraged
from turning out more than the
average amount of product during
the fixed hours of labor, as
also for working overtime for
extra pay. Improvements in
machinery intended to economize
time or labor are eyed with
suspicion and can be introduced
only after long delay and with
the utmost difficulty. In England,
as compared with the United
States, the inventor finds no
incentive. The result is that
now the British manufacturer is
unable to vie with his American
competitor in branches of industry
where rapidity of execution
is essential, or where the employment
of the latest mechanical
devices is indispensable to
the cheapness or the perfection
of a product.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that American
labor associations are organized
on the same fundamental
principle which actuates the
trade unions of Great Britain.
That is to say, their aims, demands
and regulations are based
on the primary assumption that
the whole industrial system
should steadily keep in view the
interests, not of employers, nor
of workmen exceptionally gifted
in intellect or character, but
those of the great mass of operatives
possessed only of average
physical, mental and moral qualities.
The inevitable outcome of
such a system, where it is carried
out with a completeness now
approached in Great Britain,
is a reduction of a nation’s industry
to a dead level of achievement
to a status of Chinese
stagnation with respect both to
quality and quantity. Such
would be the drear and hopeless
prospect which would confront
our manufacturers, should our
labor associations gain the nearly
absolute mastery of industrial
conditions which the trade unions
have managed to acquire in the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Should the present steel strike
prove successful, our labor associations
will have made a
long stride toward the acquirement
of such mastery. The strike
has been ordered, not because of
any disagreement between employers
and employed with regard
to wages or to the hours of
labor, but because certain companies
have refused to put in the
hands of the Amalgamated Association
of Iron, Steel and Tin
Workers the means of forcing
every non-union workman employed
by those companies to
join that society. Were the
principle asserted by the Amalgamated
Association to be accepted
by the three companies
now subjected to coercion, it
would presently be applied to
every constituent company of
the United States Steel Corporation,
and, this colossal combination
of capital once conquered,
all outside representatives of the
iron and steel industries would,
of course, speedily succumb.
From that moment all the employers
of skilled labor in this
vast field of production would be
at the mercy of the employed,
firmly organized as they all would
be in American counterparts of
the British trade unions, with
regard not only to the rate of
wages and the hours of labor, but
also to the encouragement of inventive
talent and the introduction
of improved machinery.
The bright, and thus far continually
brightening, outlook of the
iron and steel industries of the
United States would have been
eclipsed forever.</p>

<p>There could be no better time
than the present to answer once
for all the question whether
American manufacturers of iron
and steel will bow their necks
to the yoke which their British
competitors have long found too
heavy to be borne.—N.Y. Sun.</p>

<p>There is more Catarrh in this section
of the country than all other
diseases put together, and until the
last few years was supposed to be
incurable. For a great many years
doctors pronounced it a local disease
and prescribed local remedies,
and by constantly failing to cure
with local treatment, pronounced it
incurable. Science has proven catarrh
to be a constitutional disease
and requires constitutional treatment.
Hall’s Catarrh Cure, manufactured
by F. J. Cheney &amp; Co.,
Toledo, Ohio, is the only constitutional
cure on the market. It is
taken internally in doses from 10

anything else for Indigestion or

and they seldom heard of Appendicitis,
Nervous Prostration or Heart

Flower to clean out the system and
stop fermentation of undigested food,
stimulate the nervous and organic
action of the system, and that is all
they took when feeling dull and bad
with headaches and other aches.

He was formerly a grocery merchant

<p>The drouth is simply fearful. Corn,
tobacco, gardens, and in fact everything
growing out of the ground is
ruined. So many failed to sow
wheat last fall, and should the dry
spell continue a few days more they
will be without bread for their families.
Their only show then is to try
it again. We have so many good
farmers who depend entirely on a
tobacco crop for their money, who
will be left in a fix, and our stock
men who have small herds of cattle,
with nothing to take them through
the winter. It is a serious matter to
the farmer, while our town brothers
are also affected, for with the failing
of the farmer, so goes it with the
town man.</p>

<p>To get a really good cup

you’ll have to look to the
roasting and the grinding.
In ARBUCKLES’ you have
a coffee that’s scientifically
roasted, and delivered to you
with all the pores of the berry
hermetically sealed. You’re
sure of a good cup of coffee
because all the coffee flavor
and aroma are kept intact
until you want it. The fame
of ARBUCKLES’ induced
other coffee packers to put
out imitations of it. These
imitations cost the grocer

less than ARBUCKLES’.

<h2>SEC’Y WILSON’S OPINION.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Does Not Take So Gloomy a View
of the Prospects as Some
So-Called Experts.</p>

<p class="standfirst">HOPEFUL OF AN AVERAGE CORN CROP.</p>

<p class="standfirst">If Farmers Would Extend the Period
Of Corn Cultivation Two Weeks
We Could Look for a Big Crop—Says
Farmers Will “Lay By”
Their Corn Too Soon.</p>

<p>New York, July 24.—A dispatch to
the Tribune from Washington, says:
Mr. Wilson, secretary of agriculture,
has favored the Tribune with a talk
on the effects of the long-continued
drought on the growing crops of the
west. He does not take so gloomy a
view of the agricultural prospect between
the Allegheny and the Rocky
mountains, as do some of the so-called
experts who are not connected
with the government service. Nor yet
does Mr. Wilson attempt to minimize
the injury already done and that will
increase unless there is a great precipitation
of moisture during the next
few weeks in the vast stretch of country
between the continental mountain
ranges. While he acknowledged that
the hard wheat belt of the northwest
has been damaged, he does not
yet despair of an average yield of
corn in the corn belt, which he defines
as extending east from the Missouri
river to the Alleghenies, embracing
the states of Iowa, Wisconsin,
the northern part of Missouri and all
of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.</p>

<h3>A Regretable Loss.</h3>

<p>The most regretable loss from the
view point of the department, declares
the secretary, is that of the
macaroni wheat crop. For the first
time an experiment had been made
this year in the production of this
variety of wheat on a large scale in
the United States. Secretary Wilson
has been encouraging this experiment
ever since he has been at the
head of the agricultural department,
and imported the seed from northern
Africa, where most of the wheat is
produced which supplies Europe and
the world with macaroni.</p>

<p>The secretary is especially hopeful
of an average corn crop. He says it
will not be a record breaker or “a
bumper,” in the parlance of the agricultural
department, but, at this moment
the prospects favor a fair average
yield.</p>

<h3>Advice to Farmers.</h3>

<p>“If something could be done to induce
the farmers in the corn belt,”
said Mr. Wilson, “to extend their
period of cultivation about two weeks
this year beyond the usual limit, I
would look for a big crop. But the
usual season for cultivation is rapidly
drawing to a close, and I fear that
with comparatively few exceptions
the farmers will ‘lay by’ their corn at
the regular time, regardless of the
drought. In the entire corn belt, with
the exception of Missouri, which has
a shallow soil, 30 inches of rain during
the year is all that is needed to
produce a crop. If even only 12 or 14
inches of this falls during the four
months of production a good yield
can be counted on.</p>

<h3>Stir the Soil.</h3>

<p>“The corn belt soil, with the exception
noted, is deep, and holds moisture
well. To utilize this conserved
moisture to the best advantage in the
absence of rain the soil should be continually
stirred, so as to make what
we call a mulch, until the crop is
matured. Therefore, I repeat that if
the farmers in the corn belt at this
time could be shown the advisability
of extending their cultivation season
about two weeks we could look for a
good yield this year. The farmer,
like every other business man, always
does what he believes to be best for
his own interest, but in a case like
this it is extremely difficult to disseminate
broadly in farming communities
the information that is of pressing
and immediate value. By this I
mean if we only could spread all
through the corn belt the news that if
the season of cultivation were extended
about two weeks beyond the usual
limit, there would need be no fear of
the result.”</p>

<h2>Fire in a Hotel.</h2>

<p>Ottumwa, Ia., July 23.—Fire broke

<h2>THE INDIAN LAND OPENING.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Secretary Hitchcock Will be Ready to Meet
the Disgruntled Obstructionists.</p>

<p>Washington, July 24.—Secretary
Hitchcock said with reference to the
effort to prevent the opening of the
Oklahoma Indian lands to settlement
by injunction proceedings at El Reno,
that the preparations of the department
for the opening would proceed
as though no suit had been begun.
“We shall not let the matter go by
default,” he said, “but we apprehend
no obstacle from that proceeding.
Anyone can bring a suit.”</p>

<h3>An Absurd Proposition.</h3>

<p>The secretary took cognizance of
reports coming from Oklahoma that
men who are registering at Reno and
Fort Sill are doing so with the intention
of transferring their rights to
others. “The report,” he said, “is to
the effect that they can and will dispose
of their numbers at enormous
profits. That is absurd, because it is
impossible, under the regulations, for
them to transfer their rights. For
any of them to attempt to do so would
be a clear violation of the law. They
take an oath not to do such a thing,
and to use their rights for their own
exclusive benefit. There can be no
speculation in these numbers.”</p>

<h3>Alleged Town Site Schemes.</h3>

<p>The secretary also said that reports
are coming to the department of
schemes for disposing of numerous
town sites, the promoters offering
chances to the public. “The only town
sites which have been authorized,” the
secretary said, “are those of the three
county seats. No others have been
sanctioned, and no one knows where
others will be. Hence all except those
three are bogus, and reports of their
establishment should be denounced as
intended to deceive the public.”</p>

<h3>Auction Plan Not Feasible.</h3>

<p>Referring to the suggestion that the
new lands should be sold at auction
and the proceeds of the sale turned
over to the Indians, the secretary
said:</p>

<p>“These lands are as much government
property as are any other part
of the public domain. They have been
purchased from the Indians and title
is no longer in them. Hence the plan
is not feasible. Moreover, it would
not be wise if practicable, for if the
lands were put up at auction they all
would fall into the hands of men with
money, and the poor man would have
no chance whatever. Under the present
plan all have equal rights regardless
of conditions of wealth, and that
this fact is recognized is made evident
by the large number taking advantage
of the opportunity for registration.”</p>

<p>The registration will close at 6 p.m.
on the 26th.</p>

<h2>PORTO RICAN DUTIES.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">The Attorney General Refuses to
Render an Opinion on Certain
Porto Rican Duties.</p>

<p>Washington, July 23.—Attorney-General
Knox has declined to render
an opinion, which was asked for by
the secretary of the treasury, on the
question whether or not, under existing
laws, the secretary is authorized
to refund the duties collected on
goods imported from Porto Rico between
the date of the ratification of
the Spanish treaty and the date that
the Foraker act went into operation.
The attorney general says that inasmuch
as the comptroller of the treasury
has given his decision on the subject
it is a matter for him (the comptroller)
alone, and he therefore can
not give a decision as requested.</p>

<p>It is authoritatively stated at the
treasury department that the government
will proceed immediately to refund
these duties, acting upon the
decision of the comptroller of the
treasury, which was to the effect that
the treasury department had authority
under existing law. The duties
amount approximately to $2,000,000.</p>

<h2>OOM PAUL’S WIFE IS DEAD.</h2>

<p>Mrs. Kruger, Wife of the Former
President of the Transvaal Republic
Dead at Pretoria.</p>

<p>Pretoria, July 21—Mrs. Kruger,
wife of the former president of the
Transvaal republic, who is now in
Europe, died Saturday evening, of
pneumonia, after an illness of three
days, aged 67 years.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kruger was the second wife of
the former Transvaal president. She
was a Miss Du Plessis, a name of
prominence in South Africa. Mr.
Kruger’s first wife was her aunt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kruger was a typical Boer
woman. She cared nothing for finery,
and at her home in Pretoria, she had
all the simplicity of manner and mode
of living of the plainest woman of the
veldt. It was said of her, even at the
time when her husband was accumulating
millions, that her chief interest
in life was to see how much she could
save in her housekeeping. Throughout
the Transvaal she was famous for her
coffee, which she always had ready
for visitors.</p>

<h2>THE MASSACHUSETT’S WAY.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Jury in Famous Murder Trial Empaneled
in Thirty-Five Minutes.</p>

<p class="standfirst">NO HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS.</p>

<p>A Pittsfield, Mass., dispatch
tells how the jury in the now
famous Fosburgh murder trial
was obtained “in the time it
would take to formulate the first
hypothetical question” in some
other States. Under the Massachusetts
system a man may have
somewhat of a definite idea of
what goes on around him and
yet not be disqualified as a juror.</p>

<p>The dispatch says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>They do these things well in
Massachusetts. Twelve good men
were chosen to stand judgment
upon Robert S. Fosburgh, and it
required thirty-five minutes to
do it. A panel had been prepared
and from it the candidates
were called. Each individual
was sworn and Judge Stevens
then questioned him as to his
eligibility. Each side was permitted
but two peremptory challenges,
and each side had one
challenge remaining when the
jury box was filled. Several of
the candidates, although they
gave satisfactory answers to the
questions propounded, failed
to please Judge Stevens, who excused
them. On agreement no
juror was taken from Pittsfield.
Called before the court, the juror
heard these questions:</p>

<p>“Are you related to the defendant
or have you any interest
in this case?”</p>

<p>“Have you expressed or formed
an opinion that would prevent
you forming a conclusion whether
the defendant is guilty or innocent
solely upon the evidence?”</p>

<p>“Are you sensible of any bias
or prejudice?”</p>

<p>In the time it would take to
formulate the first hypothetical
question in New York this jury
was obtained. Court was called
at 9 o’clock. Two hours and five
minutes later the jury had heard
the opening address for the State.
Testimony began in the afternoon.
District Attorney Hammond
pursued an argumentative
line for some time in his opening
address. Mr. Joyner for the
defense whispered an objection
to the court. Judge Stevens
halted Mr. Hammond, spoke to
him in a whisper, and the case
continued without further argument.
Not once during the day
did counsel clash and business
proceeded the more quickly because
it was so. Perhaps when
the case is older and the defense
less fears the attacks of the prosecution,
Mr. Hibbard and Mr.
Joyner may do less whispering.</p>

<h2>Timbering a Mine Airway.</h2>

<p>One of the best criticisms of
modern text-books is that while
they describe how a thing ought
to be done, they do not tell how
to do it. This criticism was
brought out a few days since in
conversation with a practical
miner who has a laudable desire
to understand the best methods
in mining practice. This man in
the opinion of the average miner
would be considered as possessing
a very fair idea of mining
work in general, and of timbering
in particular. Most men
would be satisfied with this, but
to use his own words, while he
understood the methods of timbering
as explained in books,
“The proposition in a mine airway
is a different one from that
on paper. Why do you not tell
us,” said he, “how the sticks are
put up?”</p>

<p>Much importance attaches to
the wedging of a timber set. The
wedges should be of oak and cut
from 6 to 10 inches in width, and
from 2 to 4 inches in thickness,
and 12 to 18 inches long, according
to size of the timbers and the
height of the airway, nature of
the roof, etc. The wedge should
have a taper of about 1 inch to
the foot. When there is much
clearance space between the top
of the collar and the roof, two
wedges are often driven against
each other, one above the other.
In driving a wedge the timber
should be placed a little out of
position toward the side upon
which the wedge is driven, since
the action of driving will naturally
carry the timber forward.
If desired, two wedges may be
driven side by side at each end
of the collar, but from opposite
sides. A wedge should never be
driven at the center of the cross-beam,
except it may be in special
cases, and then only after the
timbers have taken the weight.
The position of the wedges above
the collar should be slightly inside
of or toward the center of
the entry from the top of the leg,
so that the line of pressure will
act to arch the weight over the
airway. Two average timbermen
can frame and place in position
from 12 to 20 sets of timber
in a 6-foot airway in an 8-hour
shift, but the work will depend
very much upon the amount of
cutting and trimming required
in the floor, ribs and root of the
airway, and the character of the
roof in particular.—“Practical
Mining Studies,” in Mines and
Minerals for July. 1901.</p>

<h2>SCORCHING!</h2><!-- scorchio! -->

<p class="standfirst">Monday and Tuesday the Hottest Days
on Record in Earlington.</p>

<p class="standfirst">OFFICIAL TEMPERATURE WAS 106.</p>

<p>All Earlington thought that
Thursday, July 11, was the record
for high temperature for
this year. That day the mercury
mounted to 103. Since then 100
and 101 degrees have seemed almost
mild. But Monday the
valley in which nestles this
model and contented mining and
railroad town was a veritable
bake-oven with no relief, no escape
from the heat of the burnished
heavens save in the caverns
of the earth among the
black diamonds under the surrounding
picturesque hills. It is
a blessing to be a busy coal
miner while the sun is so intimate
a neighbor. Tuesday the
same high temperature was
reached.</p>

<p>Ed J. Phillips became over-heated
at his work in the St.
Bernard general store where the
temperature went above 100.
The effect of this he did not feel
until evening when he was found
in a severe cramping spell in the
yard at home. Next morning he
was better and has since been
improving.</p>

<p>One of our Earlington physicians,
wishing to take a patient’s
temperature was bewildered
to find that he could not shake
his mercury below 102. He understood
when he found what
maximum had been reached outside.</p>

<p>Here is the Earlington record
of a continued “hot time” for
more than a month:</p>

<h2>Hopkinsville’s Hottest Day.</h2>

<p>Hopkinsville, Ky., July 22.—Local
heat records were broken
here today, when at 2 o’clock the
mercury in the government thermometer
darted up to 108. Many
private thermometers registered
as high as 112, and A. A. Winfree,
a merchant at Caskey, says
that the thermometer in front of
his store stopped at 120 at 3
o’clock.</p>

<h2>REV. JAMES A. BURDEN</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Passes Away Near Marion, Where he had
Gone to Conduct a Meeting.</p>

<p>Rev. James A. Burden, pastor of
the General Baptist church, died
Thursday morning about six o’clock,
near Marion, where he had gone to
conduct a meeting. He was stricken
with flux soon after his arrival, and
his condition soon grew alarming.
A telephone message was sent his
family, but before his wife could
reach his bedside he had passed
away.</p>

<p>Bro. Burden came to Earlington
from Ohio county about seven years
ago and conducted a very successful
meeting at the Missionary Baptist
church. He afterwards organized a
church of his own denomination and
was chosen pastor, so he moved his
family here, where they have since
made their home. It was largely
due to his efforts that the General
Baptist church was built in this city
and the re-painting of this church a
few weeks ago was perhaps the last
manual labor he ever did.</p>

<p>The remains arrived on the early
train Friday morning and were taken
to the church where an impressive
funeral service was held, followed by
interment at Earlington cemetery.</p>

<p>The mother, wife and family have
the sympathy of many in their bereavement.</p>

<h2>DISASTROUS WRECK</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Two Men Killed in Head End Collision
Near Mortons Gap.</p>

<p class="standfirst">Slight Injuries to Others and Much Loss
of Rolling Stock.</p>

<p>The wreck of two freight trains
which occurred between Mortons
Gap and Barnsley last Thursday
evening—the day of <span class="smcap">The Bee’s</span>
last issue—was the most disastrous
to life and property of any
wreck that has occurred on this
division for a long time. Two
men were killed, Brakeman E.
N. Corbett and Cleveland Harris,
of Barnsley, who was with
other boys stealing a ride. Arthur
Wade had a leg broken. He
was with Harris and Earnest
Durham and the latter was also
somewhat bruised.</p>

<p>Engineers McGrath and Porter,
Conductor Ingram and Brakeman
Eastwood were hurt more
or less by jumping from their
trains.</p>

<p>The damage to freight and engines
and rolling stock was enormous
and hard to estimate. Both
trains were going at a good speed
and were almost together before
either train crew had the least
warning. Engineer McGrath says
he could only give a quick signal
with his whistle and jump. He
wondered as he jumped which
way the cars would pile up and
whether he would be able to
get out of the way. He was bruised
and wrenched so that he has
been quite sore since.</p>

<p>Train No. 57 through freight
going south, with Conductor
Harper and Engineer McGrath,
and the north bound local, No.
82, Conductor Ingram and Engineer
Porter, met by a confusion
of orders. One set of orders
gave Mortons Gap as the meeting
place and the other set said
Earlington. No official investigation
has been made as yet.</p>

<p>E. N. Corbett, who was killed,
was head brakeman on the south
bound train. He evidently did
not realize any danger until the
shock came, when he was thrown
as from a catapult high in air
and over both engines. His neck
was broken. He was a young
and popular railroad man and
leaves a wife and one child who
live in Nashville.</p>

<p>The cars were piled forty feet
high and much of the wreckage
had to be burned. Very quick
work by the efficient wrecking
crew and railroad officials is recorded
and there was only slight
delay in the movement of trains.</p>

<h2>REPORT NOT CREDITED</h2>

<p class="standfirst">That Union Mine Workers Will
March Saturday From
Barbecue</p>

<p class="standfirst">AND ATTEMPT TO USE FORCE.</p>

<p class="standfirst">Officers, Operators and Miners Ready to
Meet Such Demonstration
Should it Occur.</p>

<p>Bills are posted announcing a big
picnic and barbecue of United Mine
Workers to be held in a grove just
out of Madisonville on next Saturday.
Union miners have been invited
from adjoining counties and
from Indiana and Illinois. It is rumored
that there is a plan on foot to
make this the occasion of organizing
a large marching party to visit the
mines and attempt to force non-union
men to quit work. This rumor,
although claimed to be based
on authentic information, is not
credited by the operators, but the
information has been placed in the
hands of county and town officials
and every precaution will be taken
to see that good order is maintained
in the county on that day and men
who are thoroughly familiar with
the situation say they do not believe
the union leaders will permit their
men to hazard such an attack on the
rights of citizens of Hopkins county
who choose to work in the mines on
non-union basis, but the officers say
they will be prepared to meet any
emergency that may arise.</p>

<p>Such tactics as rumor says are now
proposed were meant to be used by
the notorious invading party from
Indiana who got only as far as Sebree
and then did not reach the
mines or the men. That farcical attempt
was such a signal failure that
no such thing has since been attempted,
although it has been constantly
threatened since the mine
workers first set up headquarters at
Madisonville in November last.</p>

<p>Many of the contented miners have
been heard to say that the miners of
the county generally would work as
usual on the day of the barbecue and
that they had made up their minds
not to permit any interference with
their right to work and support their
families as they chose.</p>

<h2>COUNTY WILL PROTECT.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">County Judge Instructs Sheriff to Appoint
Deputies to Protect Mines.</p>

<p class="standfirst">Go on Duty Tomorrow and Will be Paid
By the County.</p>

<p>Steps were taken yesterday to put
the power of Hopkins county into
action for the protection of the many
valuable mining properties in the
county and the lives of the 2,000 employed
miners from threatened violence
at the hands of union men from
other fields. Based upon information
of threats of violence in the
hands of officials of the county and
upon the affidavits of the coal operators
of the county, the County Judge
took action yesterday. Under the
law he has no alternative when property
owners show cause and demand protection.</p>

<p>Judge Hall has issued orders to
Sheriff Hankins to summon and appoint
a large force of discreet men to
be armed with guns and assigned to
each of the coal mining properties in
the county in sufficient force for protection
of workmen and property
from threatened violence.</p>

<p>The authorities are taking every
precaution to preserve order and
protect life and property in the
county, and the preparations being
made will be sufficient to control
any number of men who may come
from other counties and states to
attend the mine workers’ barbecue
at Madisonville on Saturday and
take part in any attempt to use force
against miners or mine property
that is said to be threatened.</p>

<p>The law provides that no less than
two nor more than ten men shall be
assigned to each separate piece of
property. The deputies are to go on
duty Friday and remain, it is understood
until the county authorities
are satisfied all danger of trouble is
past. The deputies will be summoned
today and will be paid by the
county. The coal operators could
have asked this protection several
months ago, but have chosen until
now to bear their own burdens.</p>

<h2>THE SUNDAY SCHOOL</h2>

<p class="standfirst">LESSON IV, THIRD QUARTER, INTERNATIONAL
SERIES, JULY 28.</p>

<p class="hanging b">Text of the lesson, Gen. xii, 1-9,
Memory Verses—Golden Text
Gen. xii, 2—Commentary Prepared
by the Rev. D. M. Stearns.</p>

<p class="center smaller">[Copyright, 1901, by American Press Association.]</p>

<p>In chapter x we have 70 descendants
of Noah among whom the earth was divided,
and Deut. xxxii, 8, says that God
met the bounds of the people with reference
to the number of the children of Israel,
although such people were not then
in existence except before God. From
before the world was made both the
church and Israel were real to God,
and He clearly saw the end when through
them He would rule the world in righteousness
(Isa. xlvi, 9, 10). Chapter xi
tells of man’s degeneracy and union
against God to make them a name. This
is the beginning of the story of Babylon,
the end of which is found in Rev. xvii
and xviii, and the great feature of which
is self glorification. “Let us make us a
name.” Here we have the beginning of
languages because of this rebellion. Then
follow the ten generations from Shem to
Abram inclusive. In chapter v we had
the ten generations from Adam to Noah
inclusive, these 20 generations being on
the line of the righteous and leading on
to Christ. Man apart from God ever degenerates.
Sin turned Adam and Eve from
Eden, sin brought the deluge and destroyed
all except those in the ark, sin
brought the confusion of tongues, and
now after 2,000 years sin again prevails,
and from the idol worshipers beyond the
river the Lord takes Abram that He may
bless him and make him a blessing to all
people on earth (Joshua xxiv, 2, 3).</p>

<p>1-3. I will bless thee and make thy
name great, and thou shalt be a blessing,
and in thee shall all families of the earth
be blessed. These are some of the words
of the Lord to Abram while yet in Ur of
the Chaldees, by which He would draw
him from country and kindred and perform
through him all His pleasure by
separating him unto Himself and placing
him in a land which He would in due
time give him as an inheritance. Stephen
said in his discourse that the God
of glory appeared to Abram, and it is evident
from another record that something
more than the earthly inheritance was
set before him, for he looked for a city
which hath foundations whose builder
and maker is God (Acts vii, 2; Heb. xi,
10). Notice in these opening verses of
our lesson the fourfold “I will” of the
Lord—“I will shew,” “I will make” and
the double “I will bless.” The promises
and assurances are all from God. Abram
hears, believes, obeys. He died in faith,
not having received the promise, for God
gave him none inheritance in it, yet He
promised that He would (Heb. xi, 13;
Acts vii. 5).</p>

<p>4, 5. “Abram was seventy and five
years old when he departed out of Haran.”
In chapter xi, 31, 32, we read that
his father, Terah, who served other gods
(Joshua xxiv, 2), accompanied him so far
as Haran. Abram tarried there until
his father died, and then, taking with
him Lot, his brother’s son, they came into
Canaan. Did Terah hinder Abram?
Might he have gone on into Canaan if he
had been willing? These are not as important
questions as such personal ones
as the following: Am I by a lack of faith
or by an unwillingness to be separate
from this present evil world, hindering
any dear one whose heart is longing for
a closer walk with God? Am I a Terah,
saying that Haran is far enough?</p>

<p>6, 7. And the Lord appeared unto
Abram and said, “Unto thy seed will I
give this land, and there builded he an
altar unto the Lord who appeared unto
him.” We do not read of any appearance
of the Lord to Abram at Haran,
for the first verse of our lesson refers to
the Lord’s appearance and message in
Mesopotamia (Acts vii, 2, 3), but now,
Abram having obeyed fully, the Lord
appears to him a second time and confirms
His promise. Until we obey fully
up to the light we have we cannot expect
further light or revelation. This is
Abram’s first altar in the land. By sacrifice
he worships God in His appointed
way. At this place Jacob afterward
bought a piece of ground. There Joshua
gathered Israel for his farewell address.
There he buried the body of Joseph, and
there Jesus talked with the woman at the
well (Gen. xxxiii. Joshua xxiv. John iv).
The land was already occupied by the
Canaanites, and Abram must be content
with his tent and altar and to be a pilgrim
and a stranger until God’s time
should come to give him the land.</p>

<p>8. “There he builded an altar unto the
Lord and called upon the name of the
Lord.” This is his second altar in the
land, and it is between Bethel and Hai.
The margin says the Ai of Joshua vii. 2.
Bethel suggests Gen. xxviii. 19, and the
story of God’s gracious loving kindness
to Jacob. But the principal truth and
practical lesson are associated with the
altar and the sacrifice. Happy is the
man who, whatever be his home or
dwelling place or surroundings if it be a
hut or a palace, in some heathen wilderness
or in some great city, never fails to
have his altar unto the Lord! Redemption
by the blood of Christ and constant
communion with Him—these are the two
greatest things that any mortal can have,
and they are possible to all who have
ever heard of Christ and of His redemption.
He is calling all who have heard
His voice to separate themselves from
this present world and live wholly for
Him.</p>

<p>9. “And Abram journeyed, going on
still toward the south.” It is good to be
always going on in the way of the Lord.
We read of David that he went on and
grew great (margin, going and growing),
and the Lord God of hosts was with him
(II Sam, v. 10). An enlarging and a
winding about is not out of place, if it be
“still upward, still upward, still upward,
by the midst” (Ezek. xii, 7). Peter would
call it growing in grace and in the knowledge
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ (II Pet. iii, 18). But while on this
present earth we are in an enemy’s country,
for even our Lord said that the devil
is the prince of this world (John xiv,
30), and we need to watch and pray lest
we fall into temptation. If there is one
thing that the devil seems to hate specially
it is to see a believer wholly separated
unto God and walking humbly
with God, living for and relying upon
Him alone. The rest of this chapter
tells of some sad wandering and stumbling
on the part of Abram, even a compact
between himself and his wife to lie
in order to save his life, and a consequent
rebuke from a heathen king. Abram’s
faith was a matter of growth, and it had
not at this time reached to that implicit
trust in God of later years.</p>

<h2>CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR.</h2>

<p class="standfirst">Topic For the Week Beginning July
28—Comment by Rev. S. H. Doyle.</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Topic.</span>—Missions; true philanthropy.—Gal. vi,
1-10.</p>

<p>Philanthropy is the practical love of
mankind. It is “universal good will,
readiness to do good to all men.”
Philanthropy should embrace the entire
man—body, mind, soul. It is usually
limited to the care of the body and
of the mind, but should not be so limited,
because “the soul is the man, and
the man is the soul.” A limited philanthropy
is a defective philanthropy.
True philanthropy is not limited and
hence not defective. True philanthropy
is nowhere so well illustrated as in
Christian missions. The Christian missionary
aims to elevate body, mind and
soul, and therefore is the truest of all
philanthropists.</p>

<p>Missions help the physical man. The
care of the human body is of most vital
importance. It is the dwelling place
of the Holy Ghost and is not to be denied
or dishonored. The relation that
exists between the body and the mind
is a most intimate one, and a sound
body is a primal necessity to a sound
mind. Heathenism largely ignores the
body, and is usually grossly ignorant
of its wants and needs. Christianity
gives the care of the physical man its
proper place. It does not deify the
body, nor does it ignore it, but it does
give it an important place in man’s
nature as greatly influencing both mind
and soul. Wherever the missionary
goes the importance of the human body
is emphasized, and the proper methods
for its development, care and preservation
are inaugurated, and the physically
weak and infirm are cared for.</p>

<p>Missions help the intellectual man.
Christianity is not stoicism. It does not
make the cultivation of the mind the
chief end of man’s existence, but it
does believe in the education and development
of the intellect; it does believe
in and practice the care of those
who are afflicted with mental infirmities.
Wherever the Christian missionary
goes there is renewed interest in
education, in the development of the
mind. The church and the school, the
Bible and the spelling book, go hand in
hand. Christianity is the handmaiden,
not the foe, of education and of intelligence.</p>

<p>Missions help the spiritual man. The
supreme aim of Christian missions is
to care for the human soul, to have it
redeemed by the blood of Christ and
kept by the power of the Holy Ghost
after it has been redeemed. This is
the end of all missionary work. It
would reveal God to man in Jesus
Christ and have God reconciled to
man in Christ. No philanthropic work
of any other character can be compared
to this. The care of the soul is of infinitely
more importance than the care
of body or mind. The missionary
therefore in any every sense is the truest
philanthropist. This fact should increase
our missionary zeal. Philanthropy
is greatly magnified today. If
we would be the truest of philanthropists,
we must be interested in and
supporters of missions.</p>

<h2>The Light of the World.</h2>

<p>Christ is the Light of the World. Followers
of Christ are described also as
lights kindled from the great central
Light. In Christ’s life the love of God
broke like a glorious sunrise into the
darkness of the earth. We all know
how Jesus lived. He was a benediction
wherever He went. He blessed
the people by His words, which told
them of God’s compassion, love and
truth. He blessed them by His life, in
which the bitterest enemy could find
no fault—a life full of sweetness, gentleness,
sympathy, purity and whatsoever
things are lovely. He blessed
them by His deeds. He went about doing
good, healing, comforting, helping,
lifting up, cleansing lepers, opening
blind eyes, scattering kindnesses everywhere.
Christ has passed into heaven,
but He wants us to continue His life,
with all its goodness, its beauty, its
sweet service. He kindles the life in
me that we may shine as He did,—J.R.
Miller, D.D., in United Presbyterian.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>Needed at All Times.</h2>

<p>Faith is a daily requisite. It is more
than a pair of spiritual wings, with
which the soul may fly to heaven. We
want it in all that we attempt to do.
The work may be insignificant, but
faith in its success will give it dignity
and worth. Without this hopeful hopefulness
no man can please God nor
even himself.—Presbyterian Journal.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2>Spiritual Life.</h2>

<p>God has made everyday humanity,
the common duties, the common affections,
so fair, so full of tenderness, so
full of claims on our love and admiration,
that were we to watch for them
and take their joy the path would be
filled with music and our souls with
grace.—Stopford A. Brooke.</p>
